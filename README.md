# Regression
This Python code implements a simple linear regression model using gradient descent to fit a line to a set of data points. Linear regression is a fundamental technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This code provides a clear implementation of linear regression, including the ability to specify the learning rate, number of epochs, and data source.

Key Features:

The code reads data from a CSV file using the Pandas library.
It defines a loss function to calculate the mean squared error for the linear regression model.
Gradient descent is used to iteratively update model parameters (slope and y-intercept) for optimal fit.
The code visualizes the data points and the resulting linear regression line using Matplotlib.
